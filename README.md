# m4a\_to\_opus converter

An user friendly frontend for avconv/avprobe to transcode audio to
ogg/opus _only if necessary_ using the bitrate of the source material by
default.

Also provides a more conventient output (percent finished and ETA
instead of current position in seconds).

It was originally made to work with
[youtube-dl](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/), but also serves well as
standalone program.
